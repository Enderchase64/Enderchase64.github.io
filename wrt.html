<u>Overview:</u>
Global warming is the increase in global average temperature due to natural and man-made factors. Since the industrial revolution, major companies have continued to release a multitude of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, going nearly unchecked for 100 years and even with regulations now, it is not enough. In recent years, the effects of global warming have been increasingly worse and where there should be concern, there has been nothing but neglect. Big companies are valuing money over the earth.  Ice caps are melting at the fastest rate in history, sea levels are encroaching on our coa    stal cities and putting island nations completely underwater. Weather events such as hurricanes have become more frequent and have increased in severity causing people to move from their homes in fear of more and stronger hurricanes. If we do not change our ways now, by Summer 2050 the arctic will be ice free, seas globally will have rose a foot (same amount it has rose in the past 100 years), and currently scientists are calling for a redo of the hurricane scale as they believe soon 192+ mph wind speeds will become more common and a category six will need to be introduced. It is high time that big oil gives way to a new greener energy source and world leaders come together to unite against climate change. If we continue to push it off and deny its legitimacy our way of life will be destroyed and the coastlines we love and cherish will cease to exist.
