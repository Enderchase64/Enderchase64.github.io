            We intend to submit this paper to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as working with them offers the ability to reach greater audiences.  The EPA is one of the largest environmental agencies, and their support would help to increase knowledge about our cause, allowing us to connect with a broader audience. 
Our goal is to find alternative processes that helps prevent global warming without causing major losses for companies. The current practices of large companies could threaten their long-term viability by damaging the environment. Transitioning away from oil, which is heavily used in fuel, fertilizer, and many other sectors, is challenging. Therefore, we need to reduce the negative impacts of oil extraction and fracking, allowing both the economy and the environment some room to breathe. By teaming up with the EPA, we can enhance our efforts and create meaningful change in protecting the environment.
