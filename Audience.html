            We intend to submit this paper to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as working with them offers the ability to reach greater audiences.  The EPA is one of the largest environmental agencies, and their support would help to increase knowledge about our cause, allowing us to connect with a broader audience. Their own website states that, ”We don't protect the environment on our own.  We work with businesses, non-profit organizations, and state and local governments through dozens of partnerships. A few examples include conserving water and energy, minimizing greenhouse gasses, re-using solid waste, and getting a handle on pesticide risks. In return, we share information and publicly recognize our partners”. Our goal is to find alternative processes that helps prevent global warming without causing major losses for companies. We hope to be able to secure a grant from the EPA not only to gain funds to further our research, but to also have access to the large amount of information they have on the topic of global warming. The current practices of large companies could threaten their long-term viability by damaging the environment. Transitioning away from oil, which is heavily used in fuel, fertilizer, and many other sectors, is challenging. Therefore, we need to reduce the negative impacts of oil extraction and fracking, allowing both the economy and the environment some room to breathe. By teaming up with the EPA, we can enhance our efforts and create meaningful change in protecting the environment. We ask that they aid us by providing resources and facilities to help research and develop greener sources of energy that are marginally similar in price to current fossil fuels.
