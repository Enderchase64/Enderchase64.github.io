            Hersher, Rebecca. “Scientists Explore Whether to Add a ‘Category 6’ Designation for Hurricanes.” NPR, 6 Feb. 2024,</strong> <br> 
            <em> www.npr.org/2024/02/06/1229440080/scientists-explore-whether-to-add-a-category-6-designation-for-hurricanes.</em><br>
            Storms over time have gotten worse alongside climate change. We are seeing more and more powerful hurricanes where a category five does not seem to fit. Scientists are looking to increase the highest category for hurricanes from five to six. This has been an argument between scientists about whether some older hurricanes should be classified as a category six instead of five. One of the storms that may classify as a category six was typhoon Haiyan which had wind speeds around 195 mph.<br>
<strong>C:</strong> In the past 11 years there would be four hurricanes that would reach the classification for a category six if it was to exist.<br>
<strong>R:</strong> One of the effects of global warming is increase of storm severity<br>
<strong>A:</strong> Rebecca Hersher is a reporter who has focused on environmental and climate issues.<br>
<strong>A:</strong> Rebecca Hersher has got a degree in neurobiology at Harvard University<br>
<strong>A:</strong> This source is being used as it shows that scientists are noticing a large increase in wind speeds of hurricanes, it relays this information to the public in a more easily digestible way of explaining

Lindsey, Rebecca. “Climate Change: Global Sea Level.”</strong><br> <em>NOAA Climate.Gov, 22 Aug. 2023, www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-sea-level#:~:text=Global%20mean%20sea%20level%20has,%E2%80%9324%20centimeters.</em><br>
Overall across the past few years the sea level has been rising over the past few years. Since 1880 the average sea level has risen around 21 to 24 centimeters. On average the sea level has risen by 3.6 millimeters each year from 2006 to 2015, this is 2.5 times as much as it was in the 20th century. This matters to us especially as 30% of the United States population lives on the coast line. This has been caused by added water, primarily from melting glaciers and from thermal expansion.
<br><strong>C:</strong> The article documents info from 1993 all the way to 2013.
<br><strong>R:</strong> The rising sea levels has a direct correlation with the rise of global warming.
<br><strong>A:</strong> Rebecca Lindsey is an assistant professor for the chemical engineering department at the University of Michigan.
<br><strong>A:</strong> The information and research of the documentation is being done by the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration.
<br><strong>P:</strong> This article was released to show the findings and that this has been going on for some time and that this is not a new issue
