    The arctic sea ice reaches its minimum coverage in September every year. The satellite record has only been recorded since 1979, yet a trend is still easily visible. Currently, sea ice is decreasing at a rate of 12.2% each year but the rate has been accelerating over the past 20 years. From 1996, around 30 years ago, we have lost approximately 3 million square kilometers of arctic sea ice. That is a nearly 50% percent decrease (7.19 million sq km - 4.28 million sq km) in just 30 years. If these trends continue, not only will the arctic be ice free in September in the near future, but the people and animals that live there will lose the place they call their home.
    <br><strong>C:</strong> This article was produced by NASA in 2022 to inform people of sea ice loss however the graphs and figures have been updated with the data from 2024
    <br><strong>R:</strong> The loss of arctic sea ice will reduce the earth's reflectivity and contribute to global warming.
    <br><strong>A:</strong> This information comes from satellite images that NASA produces and operates themselves
    <br><strong>A:</strong> NASA is one of the leaders in searching for data on climate change and with access to land, sea and space they have the best ability to survey the current changes happening around the world.
    <br><strong>P:</strong> To help people understand that if changes are not made in the near future things will continue to get worse and become more irreversible.

        Global warming and rising sea levels are not a new issue and have since increased with two of the factors that were discovered back in 1971 being thermal expansion and Melting ice explaining 75% of the rising sea level. While the change in sea level was and still is not the exact same everywhere as it is still happening across the globe, just at different rates. The ice extent’s coverage being described “as the overall area of the ocean where at least 15% of the surrounding surface is covered by ice” has decreased in the arctic ocean. Before 2015 there was a steady increase in ice extent, after 2015 the amount of ice extent began to suddenly decrease and now minimal ice extent exists. This ice extent also helped to deflect some of the heat that the sun produces, while the ocean absorbs it.
        <br><strong>C:</strong> The paper shows changes that global warming has caused  from the 1980s to 2024.

                Marine heatwaves are one of the most destructive phenomena for marine life. Stationary organisms who are unable to avoid the hotter temperatures suffer immensely and those who can move are severely displaced. Stationary life such as coral and marine grass provide countless habitats for marine life so when they are wiped out or removed from an area, the species that rely on them tend to die off quickly. In addition to killing marine life, increased ocean temperatures help to increase the acidity of the ocean leading to potentially harmful algae blooms who can thrive in new locations due to increased ocean temperatures. This algae blooms will also kill the local marine life leading to a decrease in food supply from the ocean and a decrease in economic gain from tourist attractions near the water.
                
                <br><strong>C:</strong> This article was published July 8th, 2024 by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
                <br><strong>R:</strong> Increased frequency of marine heat waves due to ocean warming has, and will continue to, cause irreversible damage to the world's oceans and marine life.
                <br><strong>A:</strong> The EPA is a branch of the United States government that works to protect and preserve our planet and one of their biggest fights is against climate change.
                <br><strong>A:</strong> The EPA references NOAA for their figures meaning that all of the data is the best we have at the current moment in time.
                <br><strong>P:</strong> This is to help people understand that by letting our planet and oceans heat up, things we view as negative towards the environment are increasing in strength and frequency.

                    The source of the fossil fuels that we use in our everyday lives are made primarily from carbon. Many of the different fossil fuels are created by plants, these plants have “fixed” carbon to themselves and many, many years the dead plants that had fixed carbon and with the massive amount of pressure put onto the plants it was morphed into the different fossil fuels we know today. We as people burn fossil fuels to create power that we use to fuel our towns and cities. Power is made by burning fossil fuels reversing the progress that the plants used to remove the carbon from our atmosphere.
                <br><strong>C:</strong> We still use many fossil fuels today, being a leading source of energy.
                <br><strong>R:</strong> This process that plants do to remove the carbon from the atmosphere is being reversed whenever we burn fossil fuels.
                <br><strong>A:</strong> This information is from the geological survey of Ireland, who work with the ground where many of our fossil fuels are located.
                <br><strong>A:</strong> With some of the graphs present they reference a different source being the US department of energy.
                <br><strong>P:</strong> This is to help the people understand more about what affects the burning of fossil fuels has an affect on the environment around us.

        Pope Francis discusses the environmental issues that we are causing in everyday life. These issues that are caused by the different actions that we have taken have affected our way of life disproportionately between those living in poverty and those in a well of state. Pope Francis makes three suggestions on how to better improve the situation. One is to provide better education about the ongoing environmental issues, second is to provide food and water to those who do not have it as it is a right as a human being to receive it, third is to move to a more environmentally friendly renewable energy source.
        
        <br><strong>C:</strong> This TED talk is from October of 2020 and many of the issues still plague this world to this day.
        <br><strong>R:</strong> Our actions that have affected the environment affect us, this being a negative loop that our society has fallen into.
        <br><strong>A:</strong> Pope Francis has a degree in Chemistry, Psychology, and Theology. He has always been an advocate about environmental awareness. 
        <br><strong>A:</strong> These are challenges we as people have faced for a long time, this also being something that the church has pushed for.
        <br><strong>P:</strong> The TED talk is to spread the word about the issues on our planet that come from a lack of care as well as our actions that harm the environment as environmental issues often affect those in poverty a lot more than the rest of the world.

            Storms over time have gotten worse alongside climate change. We are seeing more and more powerful hurricanes where a category five does not seem to fit. Scientists are looking to increase the highest category for hurricanes from five to six. This has been an argument between scientists about whether some older hurricanes should be classified as a category six instead of five. One of the storms that may classify as a category six was typhoon Haiyan which had wind speeds around 195 mph.<br>
<strong>C:</strong> In the past 11 years there would be four hurricanes that would reach the classification for a category six if it was to exist.<br>

            Temperatures in Rhode Island are increasing at an alarming rate. In the past ~130 years, the temperature has risen around 4 degrees fahrenheit. This has helped to warm the oceans and increase the frequency of extreme weather events. Unfortunately, the severity of these extreme weather events are heightened due to the geographical makeup of Rhode Island. The flat terrain near the coasts allows for flooding and storm surges to be amplified in damage. In addition to the storms causing more issues, when compared to the contiguous United States, Rhode Island has experienced far more 90+ degree Farenheit days than the average. This means if things are not changed soon even Rhode Island will start to become too hot to live comfortably in the summer.

Overall across the past few years the sea level has been rising over the past few years. Since 1880 the average sea level has risen around 21 to 24 centimeters. On average the sea level has risen by 3.6 millimeters each year from 2006 to 2015, this is 2.5 times as much as it was in the 20th century. This matters to us especially as 30% of the United States population lives on the coast line. This has been caused by added water, primarily from melting glaciers and from thermal expansion.

             <em>www.carbonbrief.org/melting-glaciers-drove-21-of-sea-level-rise-over-past-two-decades/.</em><br>
             This article, written by climate change journalist Ayesha Tandon in April 2021, discusses the alarming rate at which global warming is melting ice caps and contributing to rising sea levels. Between 2000 and 2019, the rate of glacier melting nearly doubled, increasing from 36 centimeters per year to 69 centimeters per year. Glaciers, which hold over 70% of the planet’s freshwater, lost an average of 267 billion tons of ice annually during this period, resulting in a total sea level rise of 14.06 millimeters.
             While the article is relatively recent, the information remains crucial for understanding the long-term impacts of climate change. Tandon, with her degree from the University of Exeter, provides well-supported data and credible insights. Overall, the article effectively informs readers about the urgent crisis in the Arctic and its implications for global sea levels.
