            The goal of this research is to be able to curb the rapid growth of global warming driven by major companies. This research topic is to try and identify how we can find alternatives for these companies so they won't have to worry about losing profits and we are able to save our planet. If these companies don't change their ways every person around the world will continue to feel the effects of climate change. To those living in northern and southern regions of the globe that rely on sea ice, to those who live near the equator in tropical climates, everyone will continue to lose their way of life should things not change. We have allowed Greenhouse Gas emissions to grow exponentially with little to no checks. This not only heats our planet but at the same time makes air quality worse and harder to breathe. In recent times scientists have produced countless reports on what is going to happen if things do not change, and yet politicians have done nothing going as far as to claim climate change is not real. It is time the people stand up against these companies.
