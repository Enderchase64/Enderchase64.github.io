            This is much easier said than done. With such little time we need to act as fast as we can and it doesn't help that the political will to act is so low. Many big political figures know they will lose money if they act on certain topics and that's why we need to get the public engaged. Public engagement can keep these higher ups accountable and all act against these big companies. Raising the idea of climate change to more people can help us better fight the people who choose money over Earth.
