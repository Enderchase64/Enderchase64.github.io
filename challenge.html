            Appeasing to big oil and winning over political favor so that legal action can be taken is no small feat. Especially with the current state of the US government, as it is almost entirely republican, it will be hard to gain enough support to truly make a difference. According to <em><strong>Pew Research Center</strong></em>, only about 12 percent of republican officials and voters view climate change as a priority issue. In fact, on average only 36% of adult US voters view it as an issue that should be regarded. With such little support behind making a difference, it will be hard to turn public favor around without helping people understand how dire our situation really is. In fact even with the scientific evidence becoming stronger in terms of supporting climate change, the number of voters, especially republicans that view it as an issue has gone down since 2018. According to <em><strong>Domenico Montanaro</strong></em> in a recent NPR podcast, the number of republican voters that believe the economy is more important than climate change has gone up 13 points (72%) since 2018 (59%). That means even with current science proving the threat is real some people still would rather deny there is an issue than make an effort to help save our planet from becoming inhabitable. Still with the EPA at our backs hopefully we can persuade the majority of voters that climate change is indeed a priority issue and without any checks we will not be able to enjoy life on our planet like we once did.
