            All around the world the signs of global warming are starting to become more profound as we near the point of no return. There is a lot being done, but it might be too little too late. The EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency), has published a multitude of articles in hopes of not only informing the general public about the increasing severity of our situation as a species, but to also reach those in power who would rather trade momentary wealth for the future of humankind. In an article published in February of this year, they go into detail about former President Biden's policies aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions to a minimum. “President Biden is committed to meeting the urgent threat of climate change while empowering American workers and businesses to drive our nation toward a clean energy future. As directed in Executive Order 13990, <u><em>Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis</em></u>, EPA is considering rulemaking proposals to address some of our nation’s largest sources of both <u>climate- and health-harming pollution</u>, such as the transportation, oil and natural gas, and power sectors. EPA will update this information as we move forward with new regulatory actions.” By giving the power to the EPA to make important decisions regarding climate change, we have entrusted the daunting task of curbing global warming to a government section with a large amount of funding and nearly bottomless research divisions as they work closely with NOAA and NASA in terms of collecting survey data. We wish to work with them in hopes of deploying a new solution for the emissions produced from fossil fuels. As most people know, the most prominent gas released from the burning of fossil fuels is carbon dioxide. With the amount produced each year in combination with its residence time in our atmosphere of nearly 100,000 years, we should’ve never burned fossil fuels in the first place. However, there may be a way to curb further emissions while also adding more oxygen into the atmosphere, which in turn means better air quality for us to breathe. Although testing for this is relatively minimal, it is believe that by channeling the carbon dioxide byproduct of burning fossil fuels into long tubes filled with algae, the algae will use the CO2 to undergo photosynthesis, and in the process use a large quantity of carbon dioxide up before it is released into the atmosphere. Not only will this minimize the negative effects of burning fossil fuels, but it will also provide an ecosystem for algae to grow, and as oxygen is one of the byproducts of photosynthesis, oxygen will actually become a byproduct of burning fossil fuels in the place of carbon dioxide. We are personally asking the EPA to grant us $100,000,000 in order for us to implement this strategy nationwide. In time we hope to expand to the entire world, but if the United States changes their ways, more countries are sure to follow our lead. In addition to the money, we desire an audience with the United States Legislative Branch in order to propose a new ordinance that requires any company that wishes to burn coal, oil or natural gas to implement this system into their production. Although this won’t solve every issue, if we can use this to make burning fossil fuels greener, it will buy us as a species the time we need to fix the other issues, all while making sure we dont push our planet to the brink of collapse.
