<u>Description of Topic:</u>
Global warming is the increase in global average temperature due to natural and man-made factors. Since the industrial revolution, major companies have continued to release a multitude of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, going nearly unchecked for 100 years and even with regulations now, it is not enough. In recent years, the effects of global warming have been increasingly worse and where there should be concern, there has been nothing but neglect. Big companies are valuing money over the earth.  Ice caps are melting at the fastest rate in history, sea levels are encroaching on our coastal cities and putting island nations completely underwater. Weather events such as hurricanes have become more frequent and have increased in severity causing people to move from their homes in fear of more and stronger hurricanes. If we do not change our ways now, by Summer 2050 the arctic will be ice free, seas globally will have rose a foot (same amount it has rose in the past 100 years), and currently scientists are calling for a redo of the hurricane scale as they believe soon 192+ mph wind speeds will become more common and a category six will need to be introduced. It is high time that big oil gives way to a new greener energy source and world leaders come together to unite against climate change. If we continue to push it off and deny its legitimacy our way of life will be destroyed and the coastlines we love and cherish will cease to exist. <br>
<br>
<u>Research Question:</u> When will we accept that global warming isn’t just an environmental issue but a fundamental challenge to our way of life? <br>
<br>
<u>Public Appeal:</u> The goal of this research is to be able to curb the rapid growth of global warming driven by major companies. This research topic is to try and identify how we can find alternatives for these companies so they won't have to worry about losing profits and we are able to save our planet. If these companies don't change their ways every person around the world will continue to feel the effects of climate change. To those living in northern and southern regions of the globe that rely on sea ice, to those who live near the equator in tropical climates, everyone will continue to lose their way of life should things not change. We have allowed Greenhouse Gas emissions to grow exponentially with little to no checks. This not only heats our planet but at the same time makes air quality worse and harder to breathe. In recent times scientists have produced countless reports on what is going to happen if things do not change, and yet politicians have done nothing going as far as to claim climate change is not real. It is time the people stand up against these companies  <br>
<br>
<u>Audience:</u> We hope that this paper will reach some of the world’s largest contributors of greenhouse gas emissions and their industries. This will help us find an alternative process that does not lose the companies themselves a large amount of money but still massively helps the prevention of global warming. If these major non-eco friendly industries continue on this path, while they may be making a large amount of money at this current time, these companies will lose a large amount of profits as their actions diminishes the lifespan that their industries have. While these companies may be making large amounts of profits in the short-term, long-term these industries may very well fall as the rug of a healthy environment is pulled right out from underneath themselves. With the world heavily rooted with it being used in fuel, fertilizer, and many other different industries, the production of oil things would be hard to change to something else. So we need to reduce those impacts that oil pumping and fracking have on the environment or try to switch away from oil altogether with the world’s population taking heavy blows, but the world’s environment being given some room to breathe. <br>
<br>
<u>Challenges:</u> This is much easier said than done. With such little time we need to act as fast as we can and it doesn't help that the political will to act is so low. Many big political figures know they will lose money if they act on certain topics and that's why we need to get the public engaged. Public engagement can keep these higher ups accountable and all act against these big companies. Raising the idea of climate change to more people can help us better fight the people who choose money over Earth.
